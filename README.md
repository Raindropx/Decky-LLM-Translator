[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/alexanderdev)

A [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin that lets you translate any text on your Steam Deck screen.

It captures your screen, recognizes text using OCR, translates it and then shows the result with screen overlay.

Might be helpful for learning a new language by playing games or some other purposes (you tell me!).

### Text Recognition (OCR)

| Provider                                                                                               | Type      | Description                                                                                            | Requirements              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|

### Translation

**Note:** Google Cloud and Gemini require an API key but offer a generous free tier for personal use.

<details>
<summary><h2>How to get Google Cloud API key?</h2></summary>


### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" at the top, then "New Project"
3. Give your project a name (any name would work) and click "Create"

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs
1. Go to [APIs & Services > Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
2. Search for and enable:
   - **Cloud Vision API**
   - **Cloud Translation API**

### Step 3: Create an API Key
1. Go to [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - *Authenticate API calls through a service account*: keep unchecked
   - Application Restrictions: None
3. Copy your new API key
4. If you need to find this API key later - press "Show key" button

![API-Key-page](assets/google-cloud-key-1.jpg)
![API-Key-modal](assets/google-cloud-key-2.jpg)


### Step 4: (Optional) Restrict Your API Key
For security, you can restrict the API key to only the Vision and Translation APIs:
1. Click on your API key in the Credentials page
2. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
3. Select "Cloud Vision API" and "Cloud Translation API"
4. Click "Save"

![API-Key-Restriction](assets/google-cloud-key-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Add API Key to Plugin
1. Open the Decky Translator plugin on your Steam Deck
2. Go to the Translation tab
3. Select Google Cloud Vision and/or Google Cloud Translation as your providers
4. Click "Set Key"
5. Enter your Google Cloud API key
6. Click "Save"

### API Key usually looks like this (but you should have your own):
![API-Key-SteamOS](assets/google-cloud-key-3.jpg)

### IMPORTANT: NEVER SHARE THIS API KEY WITH ANYONE!

### Pricing Note
Google Cloud offers a free tier that should be sufficient for personal use:
- **Vision API**: First 1,000 units/month free
- **Translation API**: First 500,000 characters/month free

**From my own experience**, even everyday usage of Decky Translator with Google Cloud for both recognition and translation rarely goes beyond their free tier. 
Only once I had to pay around 1€/month - and that was during VERY active development and testing phase. 

**But if you want to stay on the safe side anyway** - you could set up a budget limit and notification in [Billing > Budgets & Alerts](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/budgets)

![API-Key-Budget](assets/google-cloud-key-5.jpg)


</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>How to get Gemini API key?</h2></summary>

Gemini Vision uses a separate key from Google Cloud — it comes from Google AI Studio, not the Cloud Console.

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API key" and pick a project (or let it create one for you)
4. Copy the key
5. In the plugin, open the Translation tab, select **Gemini Vision** as the OCR provider, click "Set Key", paste it, and Save

</details>

## Troubleshooting

### Black screen on capture
Try triggering translation again. If persistent, reboot your Steam Deck

### Translated text is too small
Try increasing the "Font Scaling" option in plugin settings

### Plugin says I'm using a wrong API key
Double-check that you entered it correctly. If the issue persists, please raise an issue - let's investigate it together

### I see nothing / Recognition is bad / It does not translate anything
Try other combination of text recognition and translation methods. If it doesnt solve the problem - please report it here [New Issue](https://github.com/cat-in-a-box/Decky-Translator/issues/new). It will also help if you attach your .log file there

## To-Do
### Functional
- [x] Add offline OCR functionality
- [x] Fix interface scaling issues on non-default SteamOS values (experimental)
- [x] Rework temporary files solution
- [x] Gamepad support
- [x] Overlay font scaling for large monitors
- [x] Fully offline Translation functionality
- [x] Support for non-SteamOS distros
- [ ] Disable in-game buttons while overlay is active
- [ ] Desktop mode support
- [ ] Nicer look for translation overlay
- [ ] TTS for translated text (press the translated label to listen)

## Third-Party Dependencies

This plugin uses the following third-party components. None of the heavy models are bundled in the plugin zip — they're downloaded on demand by a user.

### Chrome Screen AI library

The default on-device OCR engine that provides very impressive results. 
The shared library libchromescreenai.so and its TFLite models are pulled from Google's CIPD server on demand.

| Component | Source | License |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| libchromescreenai.so + TFLite models | [chromium/third_party/screen-ai](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:services/screen_ai/) via CIPD | BSD-3-Clause (Chromium) |

### RapidOCR Models (PP-OCRv5)

On-device OCR alternative. Based on [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) models (Apache 2.0), exported to ONNX format.

- Text Detection + Chinese Recognition: [MeKo-Christian/paddleocr-onnx](https://github.com/MeKo-Christian/paddleocr-onnx)
